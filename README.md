# Big Data Analytics â€“ course project 

**Built a price prediction model to know what factors make for a profitable Airbnb listing**

- project executed under the supervision of Prof. Sridhar Nerur (https://mentis.uta.edu/explore/profile/sridhar-nerur)

- Using Spark (both on-prem and on databricks), NLP packages like NTLK was used to perform Sentiment Analysis on text-based features, and Machine Learning algorithms such as Lasso, Gradient-Boosted Trees, Random Forest and Multiple Regression, regression models. Dataset had around 89 features with 224091 listing records. Also built a Deep Learning model on Deep Learning Studio by Deep Cognition, to know how images affected the listing price.
